# Jumper

Jumper is a game in which the player seeks to solve a puzzle by guessing the letters of a secret word one at a time

Experience the thrill of guessing! <i>Jumper</i> might seem easy but even the best do not guess the secret word 
from time to time. The rules are simple. The player seeks to solve a puzzle by guessing the letters of a secret word one at a time. If the letter is not in the secret word, a line will be cut from the jumper's parachute. The game will continue until you win or the player has no more parachute.
